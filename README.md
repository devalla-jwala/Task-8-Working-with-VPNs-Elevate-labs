VPN, encryption, privacy, tunneling protocols, network security

This task demonstrates how to set up and test a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to protect privacy, encrypt internet traffic, and mask your IP address. The guide uses free VPN services like **ProtonVPN** or **Windscribe**, with verification steps and a benefits summary.

---

##  Objective

Understand how VPNs:
- Encrypt your internet traffic.
- Hide your IP address.
- Enhance privacy and bypass restrictions.

##  Tools Required

| Tool           | Description                                   |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| ProtonVPN / Windscribe | Free VPN provider                     |
| Web browser    | For accessing websites, IP verification       |
| https://whatismyipaddress.com | To confirm IP change           |
| https://fast.com or https://speedtest.net | Speed comparison   |

##  Step-by-Step Instructions

###  1. Choose a Free VPN Service

Pick one of the following:
- [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/free-vpn)
- [Windscribe](https://windscribe.com)

---

###  2. Sign Up and Download the Client

- Go to the chosen VPN website.
- Register using your email ID.
- Download the VPN app suitable for your OS:
  - Windows/macOS/Linux
  - Android/iOS

---

###  3. Install and Launch the VPN App

- Run the installer and complete the installation.
- Launch the VPN application.
- Log in using your account credentials.

---

### 4. Connect to a VPN Server

---

###  5. Verify Your IP Has Changed

- Go to: [https://whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com)
- Your IP should now reflect the VPN server’s location.

>  **Take a screenshot** of the new IP address.

---

###  6. Test Encrypted Browsing

- Open a few secure websites like:
  - https://duckduckgo.com
  - https://proton.me
- Browse around to ensure everything loads correctly.

---

###  7. Disconnect and Compare Speed/IP

- Disconnect the VPN from the app.
- Reload https://whatismyipaddress.com and check if your original IP returns.
- Optionally test internet speed:
  - With VPN: `https://fast.com`
  - Without VPN: `https://fast.com`
  
>  **Take screenshots of both VPN ON and OFF states.**

---

###  8. Research VPN Features

Study the technical background of VPNs:
- **Encryption Algorithms**: AES-256 (used by ProtonVPN & Windscribe)
- **Tunneling Protocols**: OpenVPN, WireGuard, IKEv2
- **Privacy Features**:
  - No-log policy
  - DNS Leak protection
  - Kill switch (disconnects internet if VPN fails)

##  Required Screenshots

| Screenshot | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| VPN app connected | Showing server and connection status |
| IP address with VPN | Screenshot of changed IP |
| IP address without VPN | Original IP address |
| Speed test (optional) | With and without VPN |

##  Summary – VPN Benefits & Limitations

###  Benefits:
-  Encrypts all internet traffic.
-  Hides real IP address and location.
-  Prevents ISP tracking and throttling.
-  Helps access geo-blocked content.

###  Limitations:
-  May reduce internet speed.
-  Free plans have server/bandwidth limits.
-  Doesn’t protect from phishing or malware.
- Some sites may block VPN traffic.

##  Key Concepts

| Concept | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **VPN** | A Virtual Private Network creates a secure tunnel between your device and the internet. |
| **Encryption** | Secures data so it can’t be read by others (e.g., AES-256). |
| **IP Masking** | VPN replaces your real IP with its own to hide your location. |
| **No-log Policy** | VPN provider doesn’t store your activity data. |
| **Tunneling Protocol** | The method used to send your encrypted data (e.g., OpenVPN). |
